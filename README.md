## What is Vue.js?
Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js))

## Advantages of using Vue.js
### 1. Very Small Size
One of the greatest advantages of Vue.js is its small size. The size of this framework is 18–21KB. This does not mean that it has low speed because of small size. Instead, it beats all the bulky frameworks like React.js, Angular.js, and Ember.js.

### 2. Easy to Understand and Develop Applications
One of the reasons for the popularity of this framework is that it is quite easy to understand. The user can easily add Vue.js to his web project because of its simple structure. Both the small as well as large scales templates can be developed through this framework which saves a lot of time.

### 3. Simple Integration
Vue.js is also popular among the web developers because it facilitates them to integrate with the existing applications.This means that it is useful for developing new web applications as well as altering the pre-existing applications. This integration is possible because Vue.js has components for everything.

### 4. Detailed Documentation
The documentation with Vue.js is so comprehensive that any user who knows a little about JavaScript and HTML can develop his own application or web page.

### 5. Flexibility
A great deal of flexibility is another advantage of Vue.js. It allows the user to write his template in HTML file, JavaScript file, and pure JavaScript file using virtual nodes. Vue.js has proved a lot beneficial in the development of those simple applications that run directly from browsers.

### 6. Two-Way Communication
Vue.js also facilitates two way communications because of its MVVM architecture which makes it quite easy to handle HTML blocks. 

## Features available with VueJS.
### 1. Virtual DOM
VueJS makes the use of virtual DOM. The changes are not made to the DOM, instead a replica of the DOM is created which is present in the form of JavaScript data structures. Whenever any changes are to be made, they are made to the JavaScript data structures and the latter is compared with the original data structure. The final changes are then updated to the real DOM, which the user will see changing.

### 2. Data Binding
The data binding feature helps manipulate or assign values to HTML attributes, change the style, assign classes with the help of binding directive called `v-bind` available with VueJS.

### 3.Components
Components are one of the important features of VueJS that helps create custom elements, which can be reused in HTML.

### 4. Event Handling
v-on is the attribute added to the DOM elements to listen to the events in VueJS.

### 5.Animation/Transition
VueJS provides various ways to apply transition to HTML elements when they are added/updated or removed from the DOM. VueJS has a built-in transition component that needs to be wrapped around the element for transition effect. 

### 6. Computed Properties
This is one of the important features of VueJS. It helps to listen to the changes made to the UI elements and performs the necessary calculations.

### 7. Templates
VueJS provides HTML-based templates that bind the DOM with the Vue instance data. Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM Render functions. We can make use of the template of the render functions and to do so we have to replace the template with the render function.

### 8. Directives
VueJS has built-in directives such as `v-if`, `v-else`, `v-show`, `v-on`, `v-bind`, and `v-model`, which are used to perform various actions on the frontend.

### 9. Watchers
Watchers are applied to data that changes.Watcher takes care of handling any data changes making the code simple and fast.

### 10. Routing
Navigation between pages is performed with the help of vue-router.

### 11. Lightweight
VueJS script is very lightweight and the performance is also very fast.

### 12. Vue-CLI
VueJS can be installed at the command line using the vue-cli command line interface. It helps to build and compile the project easily using vue-cli.
