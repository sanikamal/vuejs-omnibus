## What is Vue.js?
Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js))

One of the greatest advantages of Vue.js is its small size. The size of this framework is 18–21KB. This does not mean that it has low speed because of small size. Instead, it beats all the bulky frameworks like React.js, Angular.js, and Ember.js.

### 2. Easy to Understand and Develop Applications
One of the reasons for the popularity of this framework is that it is quite easy to understand. The user can easily add Vue.js to his web project because of its simple structure. Both the small as well as large scales templates can be developed through this framework which saves a lot of time.

### 3. Simple Integration
Vue.js is also popular among the web developers because it facilitates them to integrate with the existing applications.This means that it is useful for developing new web applications as well as altering the pre-existing applications. This integration is possible because Vue.js has components for everything.

### 4. Detailed Documentation
The documentation with Vue.js is so comprehensive that any user who knows a little about JavaScript and HTML can develop his own application or web page.

### 5. Flexibility
A great deal of flexibility is another advantage of Vue.js. It allows the user to write his template in HTML file, JavaScript file, and pure JavaScript file using virtual nodes. Vue.js has proved a lot beneficial in the development of those simple applications that run directly from browsers.

### 6. Two-Way Communication
Vue.js also facilitates two way communications because of its MVVM architecture which makes it quite easy to handle HTML blocks.
